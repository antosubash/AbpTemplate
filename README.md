# ABP Template

This is a minimalist, non-layered startup solution with the ABP Framework with little bit of customization. It is a good starting point for a new project. It is based on the changes I usually make to the default template.

## Demo

You can check the demo of the template here: <https://abp.antosubash.com>

React App: <https://abpreact.antosubash.com>

## List of modifications from the no-layer template

- Fixed the swagger class names to be more readable.
- Added the http redirect to https
- Added a working docker file
- Made the migration to be run automatically on startup
- Added the SameSite cookie option
- Added the data protection keys to the Database
- Added Seq logging
- Added CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions
- Version the project

## Why?

I usually start a new project with the no-layer template and then I make the changes above. I thought it would be a good idea to have a template that already has these changes. I hope it will be useful for someone. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. I will try to update the template as I make changes to my projects. I will also try to keep it up to date with the latest ABP Framework version.

## Current Usage

The current usage is of this template is for the AbpReact project. I am using this template to create the backend fo the AbpReact project. You can check the progress of the project here: <https://github.com/antosubash/AbpReact>

## Goals

The end goal is to have a template that can be used to create a React + ABP project with minimal effort. I will try to keep the template up to date with the latest ABP Framework version.
