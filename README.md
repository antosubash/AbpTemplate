# ABP Template

This is a minimalist, non-layered startup solution with the ABP Framework with little bit of customization. It is a good starting point for a new project. It is based on the changes I usually make to the default template.

## List of modifications from the no-layer template

- Fixed the swagger class names to be more readable.
- Added the http redirect to https
- Added a working docker file
- Made the migration to be run automatically on startup
- Added the SameSite cookie option
- Added the data protection keys to the Database
- Added Seq logging
- Added CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions
- Version the project
